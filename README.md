# Restaurant Order Recommender System

This project analyzes DoorDash-style historical delivery data to recommend restaurants based on performance metrics such as delivery speed, order value, and popularity.

---

## How to Run Locally

1. Place `historical_data.csv` and these project files in the same folder.

2. **Create and populate the database:**
python load_data.py

This will create and populate `restaurant_order_recommender.db`.

3. **Check database health:**
python evaluate_db.py

4. **Explore SQL queries:**
sqlite3 restaurant_order_recommender.db < analysis_queries.sql

5. **Run recommendations:**
python recommend.py

---

## Insights You’ll Get

### From `analysis_queries.sql`
- **Top restaurants by average order value**  
- **Fastest restaurants by average delivery time**  
- **Average dasher load per market** (proxy for region congestion)  
- **Correlation between dashers and delivery time**

### From `recommend.py`
- `top_value()` — finds high-value restaurants  
- `top_fastest()` — finds fast delivery performers

## Streamlit Interface

You can run an interactive Streamlit application to explore recommendations visually.

**Run the app:**
streamlit run streamlit_app.py


**In the app, users can:**
- Select cuisine type and market  
- Choose preferences such as *Fast Delivery*, *High Value*, or *Most Popular*  
- View data-driven restaurant recommendations dynamically

## Future Enhancements

- Add indexing analysis to evaluate database performance and optimize query execution time.  
- Implement error analysis to detect data inconsistencies (e.g., missing delivery times or invalid subtotals) and assess recommendation accuracy.  
- Introduce query performance tracking to measure improvements before and after indexing.  
- Visualize performance and error metrics using Streamlit dashboards.  
- Incorporate user feedback and satisfaction tracking to validate recommendation effectiveness.
